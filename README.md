## Hi, I'm Ed 👋

I'm a former physics educator turned machine learning engineer from Los Angeles, CA. I've spent the past year teaching myself machine learning, primarily via [textbooks](https://www.manning.com/books/deep-learning-with-python-second-edition), [online courses](https://www.deeplearning.ai/courses/deep-learning-specialization/), [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/edizaguirre/code), and personal projects. 
- 🤖 My focus is in generative AI, computer vision, and natural language processing.
- ✍️ I enjoy writing! I've written several articles in Towards Data Science [see here](https://medium.com/@ed.izaguirre). My latest article covered how to build a film recommendation bot using a RAG system with a self-querying retriever.
- 🔧 I enjoy full-stack machine learning. Currently my favorite tooling is Metaflow for orchestration and infrastructure abstraction, AWS Batch for compute, Sagemaker endpoints for deployment, and Weights & Biases for evaluation and monitoring. I also have experience using Streamlit for developing the front-end for an application.
- 🥋 Fun fact: I am a Brazilian jiu-jitsu practitioner. Funny enough I find quite a bit of similarity between the problems I tackle on the mats and the problems I face when developing machine learning applications. 

The best way to reach me is via email: ed.izaguirre@pm.me, feel free to reach out for collaboration.
