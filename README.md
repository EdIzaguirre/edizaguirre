## Hi, I'm Ed 👋🏽

I'm a former physics educator turned data scientist/machine learning engineer from Los Angeles, CA. I've spent the past year teaching myself machine learning, primarily via [textbooks](https://www.manning.com/books/deep-learning-with-python-second-edition), [online courses](https://www.deeplearning.ai/courses/deep-learning-specialization/), [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/edizaguirre/code), and personal projects. 
- 💼 Co-founder of Los Angeles AI Apps. We build web applications with generative AI integration for clients. If you are interested, check us [out here](https://losangelesaiapps.com/)!
- 🤖 My focus is in generative AI, computer vision, and natural language processing.
- ✍🏽 I enjoy writing! I've written several articles in Towards Data Science [see here](https://medium.com/@ed.izaguirre). My [latest article](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/productionizing-a-rag-app-04c857e0966e) covers my experience productionizing my film recommendation app using Prefect, Weave, and RAGAS.
- 🔧 I enjoy full-stack machine learning. Currently my favorite tooling is Metaflow or Prefect for orchestration and infrastructure abstraction, AWS Batch for compute, Sagemaker endpoints for deployment, and Weights & Biases for evaluation and monitoring. I also have experience using Streamlit for developing the front-end for an application.
- 🥋 Fun fact: I am a Brazilian jiu-jitsu practitioner. Funny enough I find quite a bit of similarity between the problems I tackle on the mats and the problems I face when developing machine learning applications.
