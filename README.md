## Hi, I'm Ed 👋

I'm a former physics educator turned machine learning engineer from Los Angeles, CA. I've spent the past year teaching myself machine learning, primarily via [textbooks](https://www.manning.com/books/deep-learning-with-python-second-edition), [online courses](https://www.deeplearning.ai/courses/deep-learning-specialization/), [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/edizaguirre/code), and personal projects. 
- 👁️ My focus is in generative AI, particularly in computer vision and natural language processing.
- ✍️ I enjoy writing! I've written several articles in Towards Data Science [see here](https://medium.com/@ed.izaguirre). My latest article covered how to build a film recommendation bot using a RAG system with a self-querying retriever.
- 🤖 I'm currently working on a project to demonstrate how to create a production-grade pipeline to finetune large language models via QLoRA. Stay tuned.
- 🥋 Fun fact: I've recently become fascinated by Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. I find the problems I tackle on the mats are every bit as deep, rich, and techincal as the issues I run into when developing machine learning projects. 

The best way to reach me is via [email](ed.izaguirre@pm.me), feel free to reach out for collaboration.
